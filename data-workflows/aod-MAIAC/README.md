## AOD MAIAC Data

Aerosol optical depth (AOD) is a measure of suspended solid or liquid particles (aerosols) in the atmosphere and can be used to estimate PM2.5. Aerosol particles range in size and can refer to smoke, dust, pollution, etc. Breathing in large amounts of aerosols can lead to cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. High aerosol levels can also decrease visibility.

AOD is measured using satellite imagery observed from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on NASAâ€™s Terra satellite but can also be measured from the ground with limited results. Our measurements use MODIS data enhanced by the Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) which allows us to observe AOD data at a higher resolution (1km compared to 10km). 

AOD is measured on a scale from 0.1 to 1, with a value of 0.1 indicating a clear sky and a value of 1 indicating a very hazy sky with low visibility. AOD is collected at a daily temporal resolution, but we will use quarterly aggregates to account for limitations in the data collection process.
