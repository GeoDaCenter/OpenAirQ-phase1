CO,"Carbon monoxide (CO) is a colourless, non-irritant, odourless and tasteless toxic gas – produced by the incomplete combustion of fuels. While all people are exposed to CO as CO exists naturally, the most harmful source of exposure to carbon monoxide is indoors from faulty, improperly adjusted gas appliances, furnaces, wood burning stoves, and fireplaces. Low levels of CO can occur outdoors near roads or parking lots, as it is produced by the exhaust of automobiles. Breathing CO can cause headache, dizziness, vomiting, and nausea; while breathing high levels of CO has been linked to increased risk of heart disease, and caused unconsciousness or death. Susceptible groups with pre-existing lung or heart disease, as well as elderly people and children, are particularly vulnerable.

Based on known health effects, both short-term (15-minute) and daily (24-hour) acute guidelines are recommended by the World Health Organisation. These are 100 mg/m3 15-minute mean, and 10 mg/m3 8-hour mean.

Pb,"Lead (Pb) is a naturally occurring toxic metal found in the Earth’s crust, and Pb air pollution occurs from Pb particles generated by burning materials containing Pb. This often occurs in lead smelters, ore-processing mines, waste incinerators, lead-acid battery manufacturing and recycling activities, and, in some instances, the continued use of leaded paint, leaded gasoline, and leaded aviation fuel. Inhalation of Pb particles attacks the brain and central nervous system to cause coma, convulsions and even death. Lower levels of exposure produce a spectrum of injury across multiple body systems including, reduced intelligence quotient (IQ), reduced attention span, anaemia, hypertension, and immunotoxicity among others. The neurological and behavioural effects of lead are believed to be irreversible. Susceptible groups with lung disease, as well as elderly people, children and people who are active outdoors especially outdoor workers, are particularly vulnerable. 

Based on known health effects, long-term (annual) guidelines are recommended by the World Health Organisation. This is a 0.5 µg/m3 annual mean.

NO2,"Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a nasty-smelling atmospheric trace gas formed naturally in the atmosphere and important for our ozone layer function, but is formed significantly in cities by the burning of fuels through motor vehicle exhaust, power plants and off-road equipment. NO2 inflames the lining of the lungs, and it can reduce immunity to lung infections. Breathing NO2 can aggravate respiratory diseases, particularly asthma, leading to coughing, wheezing or difficulty breathing; while longer exposures to elevated concentrations of NO2 increases the likelihood of respiratory problems. Susceptible groups with asthma, as well as elderly people and children, are particularly vulnerable.

Based on known health effects, both short-term (1-hour) and long-term (annual mean) guidelines are recommended by the World Health Organisation. These are 200 μg/m3 1-hour mean, and 40 μg/m3 annual mean.

Ozone,"Ozone (O3) is a nasty-smelling atmospheric gas molecule that occurs both in the Earth's upper atmosphere and at ground level. O3 in the upper atmosphere is beneficial as it shields us from the sun's harmful ultraviolet rays, but O3 at ground level is a harmful air pollutant is the main ingredient in “smog."" O3 is formed when pollutants emitted by cars, power plants, industrial boilers, refineries, chemical plants, and other sources chemically react in the presence of sunlight, and can be transported long distances by wind, so even rural areas can experience high O3 levels. O3 causes muscles in the airways to constrict, trapping air in the lungs, leading to immediate wheezing and shortness of breath. Long-term exposure is linked to aggravation of asthma, asthma development, permanent lung damage, and premature death. Susceptible groups with asthma, as well as elderly people, children and people who are active outdoors especially outdoor workers, are particularly vulnerable.

Based on known health effects, a standard (8-hour) acute guideline is recommended by the World Health Organization. This is a 100 µg/m3 8-hour mean.

PM10,"PM10 refers to atmospheric particulate matter (PM) that have a diameter of less than 10 micrometers, which is about 10% the diameter of a human hair. PM10 particles are not as fine and so are less deadly than PM2.5 particles, but are still linked to respiratory and cardiovascular morbidity, and mortality from cardiovascular and respiratory diseases and from lung cancer.

Based on known health effects, both short-term (24-hour) and long-term (annual mean) guidelines are recommended by the World Health Organization. These are 20 µg/m3 annual mean, and 50 µg/m3 24-hour mean.

PM2.5,"PM2.5 refers to atmospheric particulate matter (PM) that have a diameter of less than 2.5 micrometers, which is about 3% the diameter of a human hair. PM2.5 are deadly because their particles are so small that they are inhaled and trapped more deeply in the lungs and bloodstream, posing significant health risks to the respiratory and cardiovascular systems including aggravated asthma, decreased lung function, nonfatal heart attacks etc. Susceptible groups with pre-existing lung or heart disease, as well as elderly people and children, are particularly vulnerable.

Based on known health effects, both short-term (24-hour) and long-term (annual mean) guidelines are recommended by the World Health Organisation. These are 10 µg/m3 annual mean, and 25 µg/m3 24-hour mean.

SO2,"Sulfur dioxide (SO2) is a colorless, reactive air pollutant with a strong odor. Its main source is industrial activity that processes materials that contain sulfur, eg the generation of electricity from coal, oil or gas that contains sulfur. Industrial activities that burn fossil fuels containing sulfur can be important sources of sulfur dioxide. Some SO2 is also present in motor vehicle emissions, as the result of fuel combustion, but is not the main source of emissions. The effects of SO2 are felt very quickly and most people would feel the worst symptoms in 10 or 15 minutes after breathing it in. SO2 irritates the irritates the skin and mucous membranes of the eyes, nose, throat, and lungs, causing coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, or a tight feeling around the chest. High concentrations can affect lung function, worsen asthma attacks, and worsen existing heart disease. Susceptible groups with lung disease, as well as elderly people, children and people who are active outdoors especially outdoor workers, are particularly vulnerable.

Based on known health effects, both short-term (10-minute) and daily (24-hour mean) acute guidelines are recommended by the World Health Organization. These are 20 µg/m3 24-hour mean, and 500 µg/m3 10-minute mean.
