## NDVI Data

Normalized Difference Vegetative Index (NDVI) is a measure of greenness on the Earth’s surface. High NDVI values are associated with healthy vegetation while low NDVI indicates less or no vegetation, or otherwise unhealthy vegetation. NDVI can be used to predict pollution concentrations.

NDVI is measured using satellite imagery observed from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on NASA’s Terra satellite. Greenness is detected using differences in near-infrared light and red light; the former is reflected by vegetation while the latter is absorbed by vegetation.

MODIS offers NDVI data at a biweekly frequency at 250m resolution. It is measured on a scale from -1 to 1. A value of -1 indicates no vegetation while a value of 1 indicates healthy, green vegetation.
