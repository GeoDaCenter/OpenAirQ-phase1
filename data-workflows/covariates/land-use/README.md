Land use is an inventory of how land parcels are being used. Land use includes records of building types (warehouses, residences, businesses, etc.) and land types (pastures, fields, parks, etc.).

Zoning is a tool used by local governments to designate permitted land use by zone. Land use records for Chicago are collected from the Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning (CMAP) Land Use Inventory for Northeast Illinois, 2013, as vector data.
