## Air Quality Project

We group data into the following categories: (1) Monitoring data, (2) AOD data, and (3) Covariate data. An overview of key features for each category follows.


Name | Type | Measured parameter | Spatial resolution | Time resolution | Comments
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- 
AirNow | EPA's sensor network | Criteria pollutants | Sensor location | Hourly data | Limited spatial coverage
AoT | Sensor network | NO2, O3, H2S, CO, SO2, PM (~10% of nodes) | Sensor location | ~30 seconds | Non-calibrated air quality data
AirCasting | Personal monitoring | PM, Sound level, Relative humidity, Temperature | User location (fixed or mobile session) | 1s for mobile session, 1mn for fixed session | Low-cost sensor (non-reliable data)
